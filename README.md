# subathon.io
Just a really basic subathon countdown tracker for the Pedguin community
## Quick Start
I assume you know how to download all these files and make sure they aren't inside of a zip file or whatever.  

**Step One**  
Register a token ([See how.](https://github.com/twitch-js/twitch-js#authentication) If you aren't much of a developer, the "Chat OAuth Password Generator" option is easier), then paste it in, replacing the placeholder text.  
Do the same for your Twitch username, and the name of the channel you intend to track.
```js
const token = 'insert token here';
const username = 'insert username here';

var channel = 'channel to track';
```  
This is a temporary measure until I include a more user friendly login method.  
**Step Two**  
Double click on the file `index.html` and it should open in your default web browser. Or you can open it manually in a web browser.
