# subathon.io
Just a really basic subathon countdown tracker for the Pedguin community
## Quick Start
I assume you know how to download all these files and make sure they aren't inside of a zip file or whatever.  

**Step One**  
Register a token ([see how](https://github.com/twitch-js/twitch-js#authentication)), then paste it in, replacing the placeholder text.  
Do the same for your Twitch username, and the name of the channel you intend to track.
```js
const token = 'insert token here';
const username = 'insert username here';

var channel = 'channel to track';
```  
**Step Two**  
Double click on the file `index.html` and it should open in your default web browser. Or you can open it manually in a web browser.
